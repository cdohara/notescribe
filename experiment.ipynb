      "So we saw, I think, in the first time, Madrid 1.0, it was AnyConnect, and then the second one it was WinSCP. So here's an example of the WinnSCP fake page. I mean, how many people if they saw this, they'd think this is the legitimate one SQ? I would. I mean, it literally is a clone of their legitimate on the page. The only user can't see it, is WynSCCP.com, since that's spotted. The nefarious thing about this is that they're using Google ad domain. So if you were to search WinnSEP on Google, the real Winnese would show up, but there's a chance that the malicious WynCP would show up as a Google ad, and that would show up before it, because a goal ad show up before everything else. So there's a good chance that you might accidentally click this instead of 301 because it's the first thing I'm going to see first. It's pretty nasty. A lot of this nitrogen family, they just, they compromised. They just buy Google ads and did it. In all cases that we saw with it, the final compromise ends with the command of control. Did anyone from one SCP say like, hey, we tell like people trying to find our products, they're getting this like bogus site, like most of this thing served to add or was that like not something you guys really saw? I didn't see it being talked about in the articles at all. I mean, the ads got taken down, so I'm just assuming either ESent Tire or Zofos or my SEP will you like talk to. I'm not really sure like what sort of like background check, like it does for ads to be honest. But I'm sure once they like told like, hey, this is malware analysis, they probably take it down pretty quickly. Yeah, that's a good question. So this was the first one, nitrogen 1.0 and the nitrogen 2.0 was later seen by P&O last year in November. So we saw two reports, and then thankfully East Endire saw it before us, so we actually had something to go off with them. The second time now. So, this is the infection chain. Down here is one point a no. Up here is two point oh, so as you can see, it was a lot more convoluted the first time around. We're not gonna talk super nitty-gritty about this because we're kind of gonna go through this, but just know that it was not just like straight forward. There were multiple stages going on in like both times. So this is the final one. It was a sliver cult. I don't know if you guys are familiar, but It's called Sliver Command and Control. And then the second time it was Cobalt Strike. Sorry. First time. So they kind of changed command and control frameworks between the two attacks. It's kind of interesting. But yeah, they definitely learned a lot of things between the first and second go through. I feel like... It's kind of interesting, that's what we're going to talk about at the end. I feel like they kind of evolved, or learned as an attacker group because they definitely fixed some of the mistakes. Yeah. Does something change with the Cobalt Strike in the last like two years? A lot of hours swapping off. I think their code got leaked. Gotcha. So that I feel like a lot more people have better terms for them. What's interesting is that Sliver is not going to get. The code is open source. Really? I don't know good. I think it is. But obviously you can tweak it and do whatever you want to it. But yeah, we aren't seeing really a lot of people use Cobalt's Break anymore, to be honest. A lot of people are using sliver. Our red team, we use something called, I think, essentially it's like a roll your own C2 infrastructure. They kind of only implement the backend. So the initial access mentioned before, you know, someone's trying to download one SCB. In this case, it was one SCB. And it gets downloaded as a zip archive. So we have a couple files here. We have two Python files, which is kind of interesting. Obviously, I mean, this is, you know, WNCP should be having, you know, just normal when SCP stuff. I mean, I'm not super familiar with the code base, but I wouldn't assume it's using Python. It was also interesting about those two Python files is that they're hidden. You can see them right here. They hidden attribute. So by default, we know on Windows 10 and 11 hidden files are not shown. So if a user were to open the zip archive, they wouldn't see the Python files. So does that, to you, does that like mean anything in fact that were hidden? What would you guys think of that? Is there something better look at? That would be a good guess. I don't know if you got also noticed the size difference between these two by those files. The one Python file is 43,000 megabytes and you don't know So there's a weird size difference going on there as well, which we'll talk about in a second. But, so this is what the users get to see. They just see setup, they see, they see a license file, they see some extension. Pretty normal looking. I mean, if you guys saw this, we try to download one SEP, which you think much of this at this point. I wouldn't either. I mean, assuming that I trust the website, I just looks like a normal installer. And what most people would probably click, they probably click Setup at EXE because they're trying to set up some file. So setup at EXE is another file. It's actually PythonW.EXE.C. Once you decompress it, you can actually see, it still has like the Python logo and it If you look at the details, it still has all the Python stuff and information there. All this can be spoofed. Like that can be changed whenever you want. But if you look at the digital signature for the file, it is a legitimately signed Python signed file. It's like this set up data at EXC is completely benign. Not malicious at all. It's actually something called Python W. And Python W is an alternative version of Python. And when you run it, it just doesn't, there's no like command window or anything like that. It just runs in the background. So it's a pretty good starting point for malware because when they click it, nothing happens. There's no, like, GUI or anything that happens. So at this point, what would you guys be thinking if you looked at this? Is there a question you guys would be thinking, like, how is the malware actually getting run? What if setup at EXC is completely whatnot? can we like not execute setup or EXC? You cannot, like, you know, someone trying to install with a CEP, could they not just go ahead, you know, assuming they don't process. Sure, yeah. So set up the EC will be executed. That is going to be what's getting called. But the question I'm saying is, if set up that EX has been up, or does the maliciousness come in here? Do we know that there's no sleep or time weight, like it's been on 100%. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mention this. The hash for this file completely matches Python. So this is completely illegitimate. There's nothing bad about this file at all. I guess this is a 5 megabyte file. The bigger file? No, no, the smaller one, because the other one is probably the Python library to help if they don't have Python on their machine. Sure. So you're thinking that there's something wrong with the DLL that's going to get loaded. Probably the X one, right? That's the beginning. So within setup. At eucc, it's going to load Python. That's the whole point. It needs its DLs. That's why DLs exists. I didn't want to. But this specific version is Python 311.3. I didn't point out the name, but the two Python files that exist are Python 311 and 311X. So what's going to happen here is that inside, how many people here are familiar like A.I, sorry, I-T import address tables. Made importing, I guess. Did you guys talk about static versus dynamic runtime importing? You guys have probably seen something similar to this. This is using a little called PE Bear and there's C&F Explore. There's tons of different PEP parsures. This is the imports, obviously. So there's kernel 32, the normal ones you expect, but it's also expecting a file called Python 311 to DLO. There is an attack that malware authors and other nasty people who use called DL search border hijacks. So essentially on Windows, It has to find the DL somewhere. And there's a specific list of steps that it goes to look at. There are certain DLs that don't get treated this way, for the core Microsoft DOLs that essentially they're protected from this DLS search order. They're actually defined in a registry key. But other than that, there's like seven steps. And the first step is that it will look from the current directory that the Ivo. So you recall, there are two files in the current directory. Python 311 and 311X. So it will attempt to load iPhone 311 because that's the file I was looking for. Python 311 is 8 times the size of Python 311X, which is kind of concerning. Like a, you know, I said it could be something like, you know, it could have like the whole Python installation in it. And that, in this case, that's not what's happening. I'll show you in just a second, but looking at the file hashes, Python 311X is the real Python. It's just really. Python 3L London is the bad one. And that's kind of confusing because their names are very similar, but just know that the X1 is the good. So the file that's set up that EXE is loading is the malicious code. So that's kind of where the maliciousness happens here. Set up the D.C is completely benign, but by the fact that it's loading a DL that has been renamed, it can inject back code. And it's great because literally all you do is use to file. You don't have to do anything else. It doesn't have to trust a signature or anything. Like you could write your own DLL and plop it in. Where Python is, call Python 311 and it will load it. That's where a lot of attacks happen that way. Like for example, Teams. Teams is stored under app data, which has like no permissions at all and all of their DLLs can essentially be approved. So if anybody go out teams, you have a bad DL in there, that's compromised. So, kind of an annoying feature of Microsoft. Well, I'm sure Linux has it as well, where you're trying to load libraries. But we're going to talk about the 11, that's the problem. And here's a picture of Viracettle where it's showing that it's, you know, mesh and all this. So, here's what 311 looks like. Does anybody, does this, like, stand out to anybody? Like, why this might be concerning? That's a large resource section. It is a large resource section. It's 90% of the file. That's resource. Can anybody tell me without reading the slide what the resource section does? Probably it has, for PE files at least, it has the icon and it's supported. Yeah, pretty much like it just, it's kind of self-explanatory. It contains resources, so like stuff that can help. I'm not really sure why the history of this exists, considering you could just have, like, resources alongside the file, but it's a thing. And malware really likes to use it to store bad things, because you can store just... That's what's happening here. If you looked at this resource section, it'd be the first. There's nothing in there that's intelligible. And we'll figure out why. Yeah, when I saw this... I mean, first of all, I was wondering why this file was massive compared to all the other files. But then when I looked at it, it's even more concerning, because I feel like that's kind of... It kind of points that there's probably some second stage or something in here that should not be. Because it's kind of, it's very large. I mean, you can see the text section at the very top. It's significantly small than the resource. And that's where all the code happens is in the text section. Another cool feature about this, Mowers, is using something called DLL Proxing. There's not a lot of literature on DL Proxing. It's a feature where essentially a DL can say, hey, I'm exporting this, but in reality, another file is exporting this. I think it's like for shimmine or compatibility purposes. But what's happening here is like, yeah, I am exporting pi-stat. In reality, Python 311 is exporting pi-staff, which is we know the legitimate Python. There's no reason that this needed to do this. I think the attacks would happen even if it didn't do this. But it does lead to some credibility because if you were to actually try to run Python normally, I think Python would normally in this case because it's literally, there's the bad deal though, right? But it's saying, hey, all these imports I have, here's the real file that you can look at them from. So it's kind of neat that it is doing that, and it's kind of interesting just because this isn't something that's seen a lot. There is one function that's not, it's called Mouth. It does nothing just like MAP. Literally if you looked at the function, it returns. It just doesn't do anything. So I don't know why it's there, but it is. So any questions? Yes. So if you were to learn the strings on this binary, and assuming that the resource section has like ASC-E encoded malicious code, something? You would be able to see it, right? If you were using straight. Yeah, I mean, so there's software tools to pull up the resource section. So there's something called resource hacker, which literally will parse out the resource section for you. But yeah, you can, if, for instance, this was 38 megabytes of just like JavaScript code, you could just put those straight on it. Okay, so quickly we're gonna talk about just the dynamic analysis of this. Usually when I'm doing malware analysis, I try to run the file at least once just what it's creating, what is dropping, just starting out of binary, and just jumping into manual code. And everything can be a lot because there's a lot of code. And usually knowing something like, oh, this binary is reaching out to a IP, we can kind of there right now and just like look at networking functions and kind of expand from there. So when you execute it, Surprisingly, it launches the legitimate one-sCP installer. Somewhere in this file is a legitimate one-s-cp installer. So that's pretty good to know, is that somewhere in there it's loaded and drop it to disk. The second part, the malicious part, is that it will attempt to execute a file called SLV.p. Under Local App Data NoteP, that's right here. That's probably more maliciousness because obviously this setup at the XE is probably... Sorry, the one SEP installer is probably legitimate. A lot of Trojanum, what they like to do is they try to actually install the real thing so that when you're running it, you're like, oh, this is actually giving me what I want. And then the background is doing something bad because if this, you know, didn't actually probably install what you wanted, you'd be a little concerned and probably would be a little concerned. So this kind of just further leads to that this is trying to make you think that it's doing what it's a standard. At a high level, this Python 311D is four things. We don't, we can't, we aren't going to be able to actually talk about these four things, which is unfortunate because these are interesting things, but they will take probably like three classes to talk about. So the first thing it does is it decrypt this internal resource section using AES. So that 38 megabyte thing, that is an AAS blob that has been encrypted and that I run time. This is the AAS blob once decrypted. It's literally a zip that contains a zip, text file, and the eugenic and one SCP installer. It's kind of interesting, so this original installer gets essentially opened up in memory and the original installer contains the file name. The file name is 1SCP 611 setup. What it's doing is it allows essentially like a configuration that maybe it's not going to be 1SCP or a different thing can determine that by just redefining whatever is inside the average of installer in TXT. So that's kind of cool. After decrypt it, it runs a legitimate version of WynSCP. It knows how it runs installer and then it'll attract the other Zip installer data to local app data. which is C users, current user app data local. And one of the files in there is notepad, and inside notepad contains a other Python installation, which is completely legitimate all files in there completely fine except one SLVW, which is a lot we're going to talk about towards the end. That's essentially the third stage, second stage, second stage, yeah. So the whole purpose of Python 311 that DL is the drop SLVWI. which is kind of crazy because it does a lot to do that yes was the key embedded yes and what aES standard is it like with how i guess that was it something that would take like we very difficult if didn't have the key like a current standard or is it like old broken oh no if you didn't have the key you probably know it's like pretty modern yeah because it's like aES it's encrypted before and Strange. Yeah. Like I said, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the block, if you looked at it, there's nothing in it. Yeah. There's no, when I first, I opened it, I expected maybe to see, like, a zip header, like, PK at the beginning, there was nothing. It was just, much gibberish. Which kind of made me think it was, was just encrypted. So, yeah, there wasn't anything, during the first attack, Nitrogen 1, the resource section just contained a zip. It wasn't encrypted at all. Just had almost the exact same thing here, but just a little different. So they, they have, But we are going to briefly talk about this 311. There's a lot here. It's very annoying because the way they wrote this is intentionally obtuse, so the way it's going to get described is not going to be the best because it is just complicated. Essentially what they do is the same thing over and over again. So for these first two slides, I'm going to go through this more granularly and then I'm kind of at a high level just explain what it's doing. So what this chunk over here does is it creates five variables. Three of these variables are completely gibberish and you can't understand what they're saying. Two of the variables, actually, one of the variables, sorry, four of the variables are diverse. One of the variables is set the Python three. The other ones can't understand. That's pretty much like right here, let's drink coffee, and everything else here is nonsense. But at the very end, right here and right here, it decrypts two of the variables, S by main and S-op function. It will decrypt them using a Caesar cipher, literally just adds four. It's not, I don't mean, you can even call it a Caesar cipher because technically I think Caesar cipher you're supposed to like rotate and make sure like if you go too far you get back to the beginning but literally just adds a straight up number to it so but it decryps them to Pime main which we talked about earlier that's the library that setup that you see is trying to import and then it also decry load library A does load library A go in here Exactly. So that's like the big core for like runtime reporting. So kind of, no. This one's even worse. So it decrypts another variable using more seizures to kernel 32.d.l. That's kind of expected because half the functions most of the malware needs is from Chrome 32. Then it calls its internal function GMZT cache process address. We're not going to talk about it, because literally all it does is just, it does runtime import address. It takes, the first variable is the library, sorry, first primer is the library, and the second parameter is the function that it's trying to import from said library. Why is trying to import Lod Library A when Lod Library is obviously already imported, because it literally gets called inside a cash process address? I don't know. It's re-importing it or relocating it when it already knows where it is. I don't know why it does that. A lot of malware will do that, but it does. So it calls load library on Python 311.DL, which is itself. It is Python 311.dl, so it gets the address, sorry, it gets a handle to Python 311, and it saves it to H-Python 311. Redefined some functions in this process, it decrypts using XOR now instead of Caesar, which is right here, is X-R-F-E, it'll decrypt to a variable called get current process. That is then used to be imported using cash process address, and get current process is called, and it's saved to each process. So this whole process of either Caesar-siphering or X-R decoding, re-decrypting, whatever, and getting called through cash process is used repeatedly throughout this entire function. So we're not going to talk about that anymore. We're just going to say at a high level. just know that that is something it does and it does a lot. It redefines Colonel 32-D0000% that probably could have just used it once. It's hard to tell if it's either them not knowing what they're doing or they're just trying to make it harder to analyze. Sometimes it's kind of hard to tell that they're just bad at what they do or trying to make it harder for it. It couldn't be both. I don't know, honestly. Probably just trying to make it difficult for the end. So, this chunk, It will call get process address on H Python. It should say H Python 311. It'll call it and it'll try to load Pymain. So this will get the address to PaiMain. And it's going to get saved and delivered. This one will call read process on Pithman, and it'll read 12 bytes to PaiMain backup. So for some reason, it's grabbing 12 bytes from the beginning of PiedMain. After that, it creates shell code. Probably really hard to see this because it's like slightly darker gray and a gray background. But the shell code that is creating essentially is loading a variable into REX and then it's pushing to REX and then returning. Does anybody know what that's doing? Like simplified? Pushing something and then it would be popping off the... Close. Like the return value? Can anybody tell me what a call operation does to the stack? Is it dope? Returned programming? Similar? It's similar. It's essentially just jumping. So you know when you call a function it pushes the return address to the stack. So when you return from a function it takes whatever to add the stack and returns to it. So if you push something and immediately return, it's going to jump. Right? Because return just looks at what's on the stack and jumps to it. So if you push something onto this group. So I don't know why it doesn't jump. Some jumps aren't limited, you can only jump like a specific amount of bytes. There is like a size limitation, so that might be what's going on here. But these three lines of disassembly or assembly is just a jump to that address, and that address is something called internal hook callback. So it's creating the shell code to jump to a function. Right now we don't know why. Does anybody have guesses why it's creating this? Just give it content. Like why it's how you... Um, no, why is defining the shell code? Is that for like position independent, so you don't really have to know, like, memory addresses or something? Like if you're... No. Not that complicated, thankfully. That's good. What it does is essentially, it takes pi-a-main and it overrides that first tall bytes with the shell coat. So it's hooking in pymating with this new shell code. Does that make sense? So whenever Pi-Mey is called, it's going to go to internal callback instead of doing what actually Pi-Baden is doing. So that's a pretty common, like, hooking technique. So it's pretty interesting. I was really confused why I was doing this, because this program has control flow execution already at this point. It could have just called internal callback. There's no reason for it to hook-Pi-Main. Like, it's not like this DLL is getting, like, you know, there's DLL like injections and stuff like that, which is where you would normally do this because you don't actually have control flow. We have control flow at this point. It's literally imported this DL and is doing all this stuff. So it has completely control over the binary. So I don't know why, but it's cool. I've never seen something write shell code at runtime like this. It's like, it had to like, it was like doing like bit shifts and like T-offie. It was like exoring on this shell code too. It was really weird. Could this have been standalone? What? Could this have been like a standalone? Like something they copied? Like it's from like another... Oh, very likely. They stole this code from somewhere else. This is probably used, like you said, as a normal book. Yeah, I mean, like I said, we'll talk about it later, but there is some weird things that they did that kind of, I feel like, shows that they might be like a little new to writing malware. But then again, they could just be doing this just to make more complicated. It's really hard to tell if it's like virulians on their part or than it means to. Yeah. So, internal hook callback. It literally does the same thing that the other one does just the opposite. It does the whole X-Oring, Caesar, siphary nonsense. So first thing it does, it handles the current process with get current process, and then it calls right process memory on itself. At the hook function address, which is pi-main. And then it writes the pi-main backup. So the first 12 bytes from the original pi-main, it puts it back. We're just essentially cleaning up after ourselves because if we're at internal hook, call back, Pai Man has already been called. So we're essentially just trying to clean up. Because assuming at some point this would return back to Pai Man and it wants the Pai Main to run normally. So that's the entire purpose of this function is to do that. And at the very end, it calls Python Dropper Stage. And that's where the actual malware happens. It literally does all this when it could have called this from Mike. I feel like it could have called Python Driver Stage in DLO, because that's where... Literally it calls internal hook in DLMang. So I don't know why I did this. It means a very good exercise into understanding just how different things can happen in Windows, but I'm just going to tell myself they're trying to make it hard to handle it. Python dropper, that's essentially the four steps that I talked about. That's where that happens. That's where the decryption of AS happens, it's where it drops the zip and runs all that stuff. But unfortunately, we won't be able to talk about that. But we will talk about SLP. But first, does anybody have any questions? I know this is the second version, right? And I think you said the second version, already was like an article. Yes, a lot. So when you're going through it, I was wondering, is it you and like, your other person on your team who's also doing this? Or is it just you and like how long did you spend, like going through all of it? This was just me. This one probably took me, So the very first time we did this, there was actually a person that, so we got an alert saying that there was a host that was reaching out to know Cobalt Strike IP. So that one had a lot more severity going on with that because literally they could have been under it. That one probably took maybe like, three days, maybe a week or two. It's kind of hard to say because there's different stages where, like the first stage essentially, I just trying to pull out IOCs, the hand off to the person running the case, because I was essentially was asked to just help with the analysis. It wasn't my case. So I essentially gave a bunch of IPs to look further. The actual like deeper analysis took a little bit. The second time around We got an alert, we didn't get alert, we got information from external like resources saying, oh nitrogen's back here, some IFCs, and we hunted in our environment and we found that someone actually had rained it and there was no alerts that get fired at all, which was not good. But based on our logs, they didn't get, they actually didn't run SEPI. So we were able to relax, so that one took a lot longer for me. I also want deeper for this one too. It can take a very long time to do this, especially if you're trying to do like full-blown code analysis, because there's a lot of code. Any other questions? Is part of like this kind of meaningless, okay, we're gonna like, encrypt it with this thing, and that was gonna decrypt it, are they just trying to like destroy your will to live? Is there any aspect of that, like they're just trying to get you to give up? So, I mean, it's funnily enough, there is a thing called like psychological, like, mouth. I can't remember what it's called, well there's one called Moofuskater, where the Move operation is like Turin complete. So just moving values around can somehow do addition and subtraction at x86. So what they did was they wrote an entire compiler which would, when compiled C, everything was moved. There's no jumps, there's no calls, it's just move. And then look at it and control flow graph, it's just a straight line. Like millions and millions of lines. So that is, yes, that is intentionally trying to destroy the analysis. Then there was another one, the same guy he made one, where he essentially made it so that he could produce pictures in Ida's control photograph based on black and white. I think the way he did it was somehow he made it so that like if he ran it on a host or look at pictures on your background and make your pictures as control photograph. In this case, I don't know because like... Because like I personally, like you can just run this in the sandbox and you can get a lot of information just from automated analysis and we can just get past a lot of this nonsense. I feel like it just comes down to them probably like... reusing code and then just probably, there's probably an inline function that all of these strings are probably encoded, encrypted, and that it's like, when it was, you know, compiled, it was, you know, expanded. So there's no function call, but we just see it as like the same chunk of code that's happening over and over all. That's what I would think is that these strings are just defined, encoded, and that at runtime they're being decrypted. they're not intentionally trying to make it look awful, but when it's compiled down, it just does not work good. Yeah, it can be really hard to tell what these malware authors are actually trying to intend. Because sometimes malware is not written badly. Sometimes it's written very well, and it does a lot of complicated things. Sometimes it's written really badly, and it's complicated just because it's not easy to read. So, yeah. Could you, especially based on style, how does Braden assess how many people work on this file? That, I don't know if I can make a good estimate on that. Because I feel like, if you looked at source code, it's pretty easy to tell them, because you can look at naming conventions and stuff like that. But when it comes down to like this file has been piled, I feel like all the human... Quarks are gone, so just I'm sure. So we'll talk about this stage two. This one's pretty interesting as well. They did a lot of weird things here. So this is a Python file that is 4,415 lines of code, and there's only one line of code in that that's entirely relevant. Everything else is not even used. It's literally just either bullet the file. And the important line is this. This import Marshall LZMH, Zip, BZ2, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then it execs some stuff. Many of you may not know when you run Python, technically it is compiled to... You don't see it, it is hidden and it's immediately ingested by Python and destroyed. But Python does produce like a PYC file, which is compiled by Python. It's interpreted, so it's not technically like, it's not like C, which is compiled to machine code. It's more like Java, which is compiled to it, intermediate language. But it is still technically. This is a whole debate if you ever look at one-bed languages versus compiled languages. I think technically there's only like one real interpreted language or something. Everything else is technically compiled and everything else. I don't know. That's computer science stuff. Regardless, this snippet is a blob of G-Zip compressed data, which when decompressed is marshaled or serialized, which pretty much means nothing to you guys just know that it is compiled Python bytecode. If you looked at it, if you decompressed it and you unmarshalled it, you would not be able to read it. It's not like just Python source code. You would have to use some tool to look at it is what the point of that is. And they use a tool to create this. And I actually found the tool. It's great. It's on GitHub. It's called Piviscape. It's really annoying because it has a built-in feature to layer this. You could just tell it, oh, I want to make 50 layers of Opuscade Python, so they don't just keep it. So there's a lot of tools for reversing Python by code. The problem with that is that they're all like, so the middle two are like Python version dependent. Like, they essentially have to write a new version for this tool every single time Python comes out, which sucks. Because, one, you first have to know what version of Python the script was written in, and then a tool has to be able to use P-Y-CDC, which is really cool. It's a C tool, it's a disassembler and a D-compiler. Uncompile 6 and Decompile 3 are both Python tools. Decompile 3 is a fork of Uncompile 6. And then there's Pylingual, which I didn't know at the time. I recently found that essentially it's a web version where you just upload your B. And uses like some AI nonsense to clean it up to. It's pretty good. But it didn't really work in this case because, as you saw on the previous slide, it's like, layered and everything is also like doing all this weird, decompression stuff that a lot of that stuff can't already. Another problem is that all these scripts expect a P. It's not a B.YC file when it's unmarshaled and everything. It's not in the correct format, so it has to get translated. I wish I could take credit for it, but I'm pretty sure I stole this from the Sentai or Sophos article. I'm pretty sure they talked about how to do this. But they didn't actually, they only disassembled it. They didn't go the decompositive route, which I did. But you can use this Marshall Dumb and then this bytecode to produce something. And yeah, it's layered 15 times. So there's 15 layers of this Python bytecode. So this could not really be done. I mean, you could do it by hand. You probably spend like two days doing it. But I opted to do a script, which we're going to try and step it. The first line is essentially defined a rejects pattern, if you remember from the previous slide. Essentially, there's the imports, like a semicolon, and then it calls it exec. And then everything after the exact is just code. So I grab exact. Rejects. So that's that fine there. We have some loop variables. That's not really interesting. Then we have the loop itself. So the loop. like condition is that essentially we are looking at our input file and we're trying to graph the pattern. I don't know how many layers there were at this. So I'm trying to find if there still is an obfuscated pattern here. And if this fails, then we're done. I mean, it's not like the best approach, but it worked for this case. And then at the end, we're just incrementing the loop variable, so we're incrementing the counter. We're also echoing out the file called the layer counter. And then we're resetting the new input to the next layer. So essentially what the script is doing is it's creating a Python script to dump the file out in my PYC file, and then it's calling PYDC to de-obviousgate the layer, and then loop back again. Probably not the best way to do this, but it worked. That's why we're doing this here because every single time we've looped through here We're rechecking this this layer Counter file because that's the new input and that's where the grab the This is where we grab out the contents of the exec. I'm just grabbing sorry correcting the pattern And then I'm just looking everything I think everything after parentheses and then we're dropping off the last byte because the last byte would be a closing parentheses. I could just put in a better Reject query to be honest to include the closing parentheses. I'm not sure why it didn't. It was working in this. And then here we are producing our Python file which is kind of like where the core of this is. This Python file is re-importing those functions we saw earlier. We're importing Marshall and importing disk. This right here, This string is the magic bytes that starts at the YC file. That just has to get appended to the beginning so it detects that it is a PIC file. We open off, we open the bytecode file called bytecode counter. PYC, we first write that string and then we write the return of this, which I honestly couldn't really explain why this is working. It's been a while. But just know that produces a output that is understood as PYC. So at that point in time, we're not actually running that, we're just carrying that to a file, so that is just defining that string. Now we run it with Python 3, and then after that, so that is going to produce the bytecode, then we send that bytecode to PYCDC, and then we send the output of that to the next layer. So essentially we were just peeling away layer by layer by layer with the script. There's probably other ways to write this. When I first tried to write this, I wanted to do it purely in Python, because I know Python better than Bash. But then I realized I was going to have to interact with underlying system binaries and also have to do file redirections. And I did not want to deal with Python's like sub-process modules. So I just wrote the Bash strips that writes a Python file and runs the Python file. But like I said, there's probably better ways to do this. In this case, it works. But where I'm confused is, I guess, At what point in this, did you know, like, oh, yeah, it was 15 layers, so I guess, like, how are you? So there's a counter that, oh, it's like, right here. You know, is layer 14, like, a version 15, like, read a block if you compile? I guess, like, are you manually checking it, or is there somewhere in there that, like, Well, the first time, I think I just ran that in the inner layer of Python. I wrote that first and I ran it and I was like, oh, there's another layer. And then I ran it on that other layer. I'm like, oh, there's another layer. So at that point, I was like, okay, I'm just going to write. this bash script to essentially encapsulate it and run it. And then once that pattern, the pattern essentially is once the tactic if it's still obfuscated. I'm assuming that the de-obuscated Python is not going to be containing Isaac. It could. So this could technically have looped forever and done nothing after a specific layer, but it didn't. Layer 15 actually broke. Yeah, pretty much I knew that it was done in layer 15 because it broke. But assuming this would have worked correctly, it would have just stopped at layer 15 in the script. Anybody have any other questions? Yeah. It seems a little... So you run into the halting problem where you can have like an actual executive within the actual Python, so it feels really... Like I got lucky or? Yeah, or rather either Pfeikisket is really naive with how it's doing it. It's just giving you like a really straight format doing some... Oh, yes. Yeah, I mean like Pipiscay, I mean, I don't know the author who wrote it. He could have done it for fun. He could have done it for a school project. Who knows why he wrote it, so I don't know if his intent... Granted, the attackers could have done more. They literally didn't do anything. They just ripped the tool off the shelf and ran it. So yeah, they could have, I mean, they could have, like, I don't know if there's another Python variation of exec, but they could have done more stuff. I mean, like, I could have assumed that exec had to be on the first line, and I could have, like, done something out of the pattern, but, or they could have, like, split the exec into multiple things. Yeah, I definitely got lucky with their laziness. them just not knowing what to do. So, layer 15. During the entire problem, I did run into problems with P-Y-C-D-C. So P-Y-C-D-C, it implements various operations, and not all the operations that Python can do are implemented by P-Y-C-D-C. So I had, like, essentially go into P-Y-C-D-C's source code, Find where the operations were defined. It was like a jacking and a case statement and I had to define the operation that I was missing and just make it do not And was really trusting that it was going to work and thankfully it did because I could have broken everything But essentially I just were overrored in stuff code to do it and I think now honestly they've implemented more of their operations But thankfully at the time It still did break completely at the 15th layer. However, it was able to deobuscate half of the 15th layer. Turns out that half of the 15th layer is just the P. Once again, they're just padding their files with more nonsense. Because none of the code in this P.E. file was used at all. It was just there to make it more hard to analyze. But I was able to pull up the rest of the just using Python's disassembly module, which could have been used this entire time, except that this assembly module would have to get used repeatedly throughout the whole thing, and like pulling out that this assembly would have been way harder than using. This is the disassembly that's wrong with it. So, first thing is that the script calls this internal function. called Git DL-L-Path. I had no idea how to read Python disassembling when this happened. Thankfully, it's very easy. I mean, we see right here, calls load global up-Get-D-L-L-Path. We can kind of just assume that it's loading something. And then it calls call function. Turns out that load global just saves it to the stack and call function just reads what's never on the stack. So without even knowing that you could probably just make some deduction that it's going to call whatever it just loaded, which is Git DL Path. And then it stores that at link by storefast. So literally calls get DELPath or a return is stored at link. So get DELPath turns a URL path for a local file path. In case you guys weren't aware, you can actually define local file pass as a URL. Which fly does this and the... Actually, I do have an idea why. Then it loads some hard-coded values for an IV in a key. We can see here that they're actually base 64 encoded, and then it calls a load global base 64-de-load method, basic 4 decode, call method. So same thing, it decodes these and sets these to key in IV. Then it calls URL-Lid request, requests, and URL-Lub requests, URL open, and read, to read the local file. If they just define the files of like a normal file path, they could have just ran or open and read. So I'm not sure why they use URL. It feels like another weird course. But they're doing it. So that's what this chunk is doing. So at this point in time, we've read this local file. The file itself is on data. AES. And then we're going to load the files, contents, load the IV, load the key, and then we're going to encrypt up. Pretty, pretty strictly. Using AAS, once again. And at the very end, we're going to load it using the memory module into memory, and then we're going to load the method, get process, sorry, we're going to load get process address and load CERTW, and we're going to call CARTW. So we're loading something in memory and we're calling CERTW, which is where the execution starts. So all SLV.PY does is it decrypts a local file, loads it in the memory and starts execution at a file called StartW. And that is stage. So the internal name of this was called Hungry Becker. If you look at a lot of sliver files, they all have them to their name. So that doesn't mean anything just the name. At this point, we didn't actually continue analysis of this because we didn't see it. And that it seemed like it was a pretty good standard off-the-shelf, so it just had a bunch of commands, nothing super interesting. And it was officicated because they love obfuscating their code, and it was used with something called Gaffiscape, Gophiscape. What could have been dangerous with this, though, this is technically considered fileless malware. because technically the file when it is executable does not exist on disk. It exists on disk as an encrypted form, but when it's decrypted, it's all that memory. So say I was never to acquire SLV.PY required data data.aes, we may not have been able to analyze this at all because it doesn't exist on disk in a way that we can retrieve it, which phyllis and hours very dangerous in that sense. And that's kind of what happened with the kubalt-strike plan, is that kubold strike got downloaded in memory as well. And we weren't able to actually analyze the kubal-strike implant during nitrogen 1, because was a memory. And to essentially capture laptops memory regions constantly is obviously pretty expensive, especially if you have researchers that have like 64 gigabytes for RAM space. So while those malware is really trying to actually acquire. So very quickly, we're going to talk nitrogen 1 and the changes that it's... This is the flow path for nitrogen 1 by SOFOS. It's a lot more convoluted. This one was already convoluted. This one's even worse. They used two versions of the DL doododer. First of all, they try to pretend to be MSI.DL, which is called the Nitro Installer by them. Then after that, they drop onto Python files, blah, blah, blah. They then tried to the Python 310, because back then they were masquerading as a Python 310, not 311. And then they, after the 310 gets loaded, called Nitrogen Stager, They use a interpreter shell to then download more junk onto your computer, which then finally reaches up the cobalch. I don't know why, because it feels like they're doing a lot of risk, to be honest, at this point. I mean, we saw here they minimize this by a ton, right? Like the newer version, they do one DLO order, and they go straight to the C2. This one, I mean, they literally download metterpreterpreter just to download Cobbott Strikes, which is kind of weird because a Cobbott Strike is a C2, Metterpreterpreter is a shell, but I mean they have shell at that point of Cobbub Strike. Another really cool thing that they did for me, they left their debug strings in the binary. So when you run the file normally, if you run Python, It doesn't pop up. It is running PythonW. However, if you run Python.exe, since it's a load order injection, it will give you a really nice window where it says nitrogen activated, and then it'll tell you all the IPs that it's trying to connect to. So that's really cool that they left that in there. They did not leave that in there for the second thought. They also let the PDP path inside their binary, which a lot of people do, but it can get, wipe it pretty easily. So we like that's also how people know it was called nitrogen because within the PDP PDB path it was literally called like nitrogen project or something. And also they call nitrogen there. So yeah, I don't remember the articles like SOFOS and ESENTI are messaging that. I feel like our hashes were different. I kind of wonder if we accidentally got a debug version that wasn't supposed to get sent out because that lists off like 20Ds. I mean it was pretty fine that's IPs. The fact that I could just run Python and let that sit for a little bit as it tries to touch different IPs. We also would have found their Word server, WordPress server, and it just had like an open file listing, which is really cool. We were really surprised when we find the home list because it's not something you normally seen or they just have their source code there. Not source code, but file listing. Essentially, this ISO and Zip file was the attack. The first time we got an ISO file, so this is literally one we saw, and then the second time we got a zip. But during their first attack, they were sending out ISO's and Zips, and I think they also sent out RARs too. There's this unzipped.b that literally just implements unzip and batch script in case, for whatever reason, Windows didn't have one zip. I don't know why I knew it, but they have that there just in case. Python.bat essentially contained a bunch of commands that were seen on our side that were executed by interpreter. There were mistakes, like misspelled stuff when we saw it. So I feel like when we saw it, they actually had a person typing in those commands, and then when other people saw it and when we saw it here, they had converted it to a manuscript to produce mistakes. And then there's also this Python set, which contains a completely legitimate version of an embedded Python, which is what was seen downloaded on some of our host as well. And then there's these three Python files, which is kind of... So we have Pushpop, Pushpop, and all the other ones, they are the same. Literally all they do is they reach out to a bad server and try to download some code and execute it. Nitrogen 1.0, we saw Pop getting downloaded. They tried to execute Push.P.I. first and then execute Pop, but Push was never downloaded. It's also interesting, pop does not exist on their file estate anymore, it's just Push. So I think they kind of changed halfway through it. There's PP, which contains the same code as Pop and Push, except that it dumps an output to a log file and the standard output, which I don't feel like that's what they would want. victim themselves. So whatever, however this is the interesting. So there's pp3.py. This should look pretty familiar. This is the same similar, obfuscated like Python bytecode that we saw before. When it gets de-obuscated it becomes this. We can see here that it's very similar to what we saw where it calls your old web requests on a specific HTTP file. And that's kind of why I think we saw it in, I think that's why in our version, URLPath was a, sorry, the file path was still a URL path because they're still using the same basic code. So I feel like this PP3 was like a pre-evolution of what SLB became, which is kind of cool actually. So at a high level, Nitrogen 1 versus 2. But there is a ton of mistakes in the original line. There's way more like moving parts, and they seem to really condense it all, which is kind of cool because April was when we saw nitrogen 1. November was when we saw nitrogen 2. They literally able to like condense half of their attack flow in a couple months, which is pretty interesting. They also cleaned up a lot of their mistakes, so there was no more debunk stringer on the second level. It's not every day where we get the seat like malware kind of, I mean the core of it was still the same, right? It was still doing the exact same thing, but it was more of an efficient way. It also added a lot more. Yeah, here we have some references. You guys probably already know about practical hour analysis, but, sorry to Mark earlier. I still found a book that's better than this. This one's pretty good, except it talks a lot about detection engineering, which I don't care as much about. Packed, I don't really like Pax books, but this one was actually fairly good. And then JavaScript, this, the JavaScript one's not supposed to be on there, that's from a lot. But that's a good job for questions. Okay. Okay. And whoever can stay around, please ask questions. Should we be? Say it. Then be stranger. Now you're living on your own three hours straight. We can take questions.\n"

      "\n",
      "The lecture focuses on the analysis of two malware attacks, called Nitrogen 1.0 and Nitrogen 2.0, that involved deceptive software download pages leading to malware installation. Specifically, it discusses how attackers create fake websites mimicking legitimate software providers like WinSCP to trick users into downloading malware. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Fake Download Pages:\n",
      "- Users may see ads for fake pages on platforms like Google Ads, which can appear before legitimate search results and trick users into visiting malicious sites.\n",
      "- The Nitrogen group bought Google ads to promote these malicious links.\n",
      "- Despite takedown efforts, such ads occasionally appeared and led to user compromise.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Infection Process:\n",
      "- An analysis of initial infection chains suggests a complicated, multi-stage process.\n",
      "- The first stage often involves downloading an apparently legitimate software packaged with malicious files.\n",
      "- The attackers use techniques such as DLL search order hijacking where the legitimate application's DLL is replaced with a malicious counterpart in the same directory.\n",
      "- In the case of WinSCP, hidden Python files and DLL files were included with the software ZIP to facilitate this hijacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evolution and Analysis:\n",
      "- Nitrogen malware has evolved from its 1.0 version to 2.0, learning and improving its methodologies.\n",
      "- Command and Control (C&C) frameworks have changed from Sliver to Cobalt Strike, indicating adaptation by attackers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Technical Aspects:\n",
      "- Malware detail involves a payload hidden in resource sections of files that go through encryption and loading stages before execution.\n",
      "- Techniques such as DLL proxying help to maintain execution flow and mask malicious intent.\n",
      "- On Windows, DLLs have a specific load order, and attackers take advantage of this by placing malicious DLLs in expected directories (DLL hijacking).\n",
      "  \n",
      "### Obfuscation and Analysis Challenges:\n",
      "- Painstaking manual analysis is often required, complicated by deliberate obscuring techniques.\n",
      "- Deobfuscation of multiple layers of Python code revealed the malware's reliance on compiling and execution in memory, circumventing typical file-based detection.\n",
      "- A script was used to automate the de-obfuscation process layered over 15 iterations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Defensive Measures:\n",
      "- The presentation highlights analyzing debug and log information that is often inadvertently left by attackers, providing clues to malicious presence.\n",
      "- Strategies include monitoring for unexpected network connections and abnormal application behavior, with special attention to layers where malware may decrypt or store itself temporarily.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Audience Interaction:\n",
      "- Attendees engaged with questions about specific technologies like Cobalt Strike, potential defenses, and practical implications for analysis.\n",
      "- The presenter emphasized methodologies for extracting malicious payloads from their obfuscated forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusions:\n",
      "- Changes in malware strategies and code can reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape, such as shifts away from certain C&C frameworks.\n",
